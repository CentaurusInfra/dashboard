## About

This project is based on [Kubernetes Dashboard v.2.0.0-beta4](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/tree/v2.0.0-beta4). It's always recommended to follow the docs from the original project for guidance such as project overview, installation and trouble shooting, you can access them [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/README.md).

## Project Overview

The Dashboard is a portal to connect and manage your centaurus clusters. A Centaurus cluster is composed of [Arktos](https://github.com/centaurus-cloud/arktos) and [Mizar](https://github.com/centaurus-cloud/mizar). Arktos is the cluster management system evolved from Kubernetes, it is the core module of the cluster and Mizar is a cloud networking module that works on top of that. The Dashboard interacts mostly with Arktos, and it's required to set up a working Arktos cluster.

## Features and Roadmap

The following features are currently under development or on the road map:

- Multi-Tenancy (ðŸš§)
- Multi-Region (ðŸ›£)
- VM Pod (ðŸ›£)
- Mizar Integration (ðŸ›£)
